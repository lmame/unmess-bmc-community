**What does it do:**  
This Chrome extension will cleanup a BMC Community question since right now it is a misery to try and see what is happening there...
  
<br>

**How to use it for Question:**  
Display a community question, click on the broom icon to display a popup, click on the broom.    
  
It will:  
* Display all comments,
* Replace the useless "3 days ago" information by the real timestamp,
* Will display all messages as a single thread (no indentation),
* Comments are displayed in chronological order,
* First post "marked as best" is removed,

<br>

**How to use it for Group Feed:**  
Display a group feed ('New Posts'), click on the broom icon to display a popup, you can enter a value on the number of pages you want to load (max is 10), click on the broom.

It will:  
* Remove announcements,
* Compress the header,
* Remove all questions useless stuff (upvote, best answer etc...),
* Display only the title and make it clickable (green if it has a best answered),
* Put more information next to the timestamp (views, answers, upvotes),
* Change the layout dramatically,

<br> 

**How to install:**  
Unzip the chrome extension zip file (or get the folder),  
  
On Chrome:
* Open the url "chrome://extensions/",
* Enable "developer mode" (top right),
* Click on "Load Unpacked",
* Select the bmcCommunityChromeExtension Folder,
  
A broom icon should appear in your extensions, you can pin it to always see it.

<br>

**How to Update:**  
Unzip the chrome extension zip file (or get the folder), replace the old files by the new ones.  
You need to update the extension in chrome now.

On Chrome:
* Open the url "chrome://extensions/",
* Enable "developer mode" (top right) (this is not mandatory but this way you can see the plugin version),
* If you replaced the files at the same location, just hit the refresh button in the extension (the circle icon next to the disable toggle on the right),
* If you are unsure, "Remove" the extension and "Load" it again (see steps above),
* You can check the version has changed,

**License / support:**  
This extension is released by Laurent Matheo and "as is". There is no warranty, liability or support.  
This is not an official extension for the BMC Community but just an attempt to make it more bearable...  
If you wish to fork, modify, use the code for something else feel free to do so :)
